<h1>3. Record Fields</h1>

<p>
The <strong>VAL</strong> field holds the current proposed value to
send to the <strong>OUT</strong> link.  When this value is sent is
determined by how long ago a value was previously sent, and
the <strong>DLY</strong> delay value.  If a value was sent longer than
the daly value ago, the value gets sent immediately, otherwise the
latest <strong>VAL</strong> value gets sent once the time since the
last time a value was sent has been reached.  The value that was last
sent is shown in the <strong>SENT</strong> field.
</p><p> The <strong>VAL</strong> field can be clipped when the
<strong>DRVH</strong> high limit is set to a larger value than
the <strong>DRVL</strong> low limit (otherwise clipping is turned
off).  If the value falls outside the clipping range, it will be reset
to the relevant limit, and the <strong>DRVCS</strong> status will be
set to "Clipped".
</p><p> The <strong>PREC</strong> field defines the resolution
of <strong>VAL</strong>, while the <strong>DPREC</strong> field
defines the resolution of <strong>DLY</strong>.
</p><p>
The version of the record is kept in <strong>VER</strong> as a string,
in the form of "0-9-1".

<p><h1>4. Record Support Routines</h1>

<h3>init_record</h3>
<p>
The timing callbacks are configured, and the OUT link is checked.  The
DRVH and DRVL limits are checked to see if a positive range is
defined.
</p><p>
</p>

<h3>process</h3>

<p>
The validity of the OUT output link is checked to make sure it is a
connected PV.
</p><p> 
The VAL field is checked against the DRVH and DRVL limits (if they are
engaged).  If the value is out of bounds, the VAL value is clipped
back to the relevant limit value, and the DRVCS status is set to
"Clipped".
</p><p> 
The timing system then runs.  If there has been no value sent
to the OUT link in DLY seconds, then the VAL value is sent to OUT
immediately.  Otherwise, an internal flag is set that triggers the
value being sent to OUT when the delay has been met.
</p><p> 
The SENT field is whatever was last sent to OUT.
</p>

<h3>special</h3>

<p>
Changing the DLY delay will cause the current timed callback (used for
timing) to be canceled, and a new one with the current DLY value will
be started to replace it.  This is to make sure if someone changes the
value to a very long value, then wants to make it much shorter, you
don't have to wait that long delay.
</p><p> 
Changing the DRVH and DRVL limits will trigger a check of the range to
make sure that the range is positive.  If positive, a check is made to
see if the current value is out of bounds or not.  If it is, VAL is
not immediately changed, but any further processing will cause it to
be clipped back into range.
